<div ng-controller="DataAnalysisController">
	A data analysis section. 
	This is going to be harder, statistics like.. 
	<ul>
		<li>data ownership and skew</li>
		<li>empty objects or object count as percentage of total data storage</li>
		<li>fields on objects that are candidates for re-use</li>
		<li>objects that haven't been used lately (sort by last modified dates?)</li>
		<li>unused record types / record types</li>
	</ul>
