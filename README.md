TODO - document this thing for github :)



This is not ready for prime time release by any stretch of the imagination. 

The goal of this is to produce an app that is deployed to Heroku, will allow you to a Salesforce org and get some statistics.
Is really an exercise in using the APIs to see how much we can really get out of it
